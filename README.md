# ECS36B

This repo is intented for students enrolled in ECS 36B, offered by the Department of [Computer Science @ University of California, Davis](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/).

## Goals 
1. Contains all the slides and programs that I presented for my discussions during Winter 2020.
2. This repo will assist students to get a quick understanding of the basic concepts of C++.

## Acknowledgement
Most of the topics that I cover are inspired from the contents of [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/).\
I believe this is one of the best places to learn cpp since a lot of authors collaborate together and really dumb down the whole explanation.
Some of the programs are also inspired from [geeksforgeeks.org](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
